KKKill the Fetus is the third studio album by Esham. Released in 1993, the album's lyrics focus on subjects such as abortion and murder. The album, which has been cited as an iconic horrorcore album, has been praised for its genre-defining production and lyrics. It is considered to be Esham's critical breakthrough, compared to lackluster reviews of his previous albums. The single "Sunshine" received very heavy radio play nationally. The music video for "HeltersKKKelter" was featured on an episode of Yo! MTV Raps in 1994, and was given out at Rock of Ages in rare VHS form during the promotional launch.
