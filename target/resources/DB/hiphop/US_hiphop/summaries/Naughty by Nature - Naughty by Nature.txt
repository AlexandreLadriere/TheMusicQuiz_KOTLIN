Naughty by Nature is the self-titled second album from Naughty by Nature, released on September 3, 1991 through Tommy Boy Records. It was a critical and commercial success, having been certified platinum on February 6, 1992, thanks in large part to the hit single, "O.P.P.", which reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1991. The album is now out of print.
Additional singles released from the album were "Everything's Gonna Be Alright" and "Uptown Anthem", both of which were minor hits on the Billboard charts.
