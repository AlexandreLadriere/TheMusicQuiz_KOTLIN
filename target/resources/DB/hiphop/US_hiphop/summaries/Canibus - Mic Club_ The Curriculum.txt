Mic Club: The Curriculum is the fourth studio album by rapper Canibus, released on November 19, 2002 through Canibus' own label, Mic Club Music. It is generally recognized for its scholarly vocabulary and complex lyrics. Much of the production is handled by relatively unknown producers, though the album has been praised overall for its lyrics and beats. It contains over 1,000 bars combined throughout the thirteen tracks, with only three choruses in "Behind Enemy Rhymes", "'C' Section", and "Liberal Arts".
A limited number of autographed albums were sold exclusively through Micclub.net when it premiered. There was also a rare random insert which could be redeemed for an autographed microphone by Canibus.
