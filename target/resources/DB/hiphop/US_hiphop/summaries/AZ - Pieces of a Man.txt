Pieces of a Man is the second studio album by rapper AZ. The album was highly praised for its complex and insightful lyricism.  The first single was intended  to be "Hey AZ" featuring SWV, using the same sample as Mariah Carey's song "Honey", "Hey DJ" by The World's Famous Supreme Team. Both were released in summer of 1997. A video for "Hey AZ" was shot, but the song was not included on the album release in the spring of 1998. The album went on to sell over 438,000 copies  
After the release of the album, Noo Trybe Records took AZ off of their roster.
