Always Has Beenis the first EP released by indie hip hop artist J-Live, released in 2003 on the label Triple Threat Productions. It is an EP and consists of six songs recorded early in J-Live's career, prior to the release of his first album The Best Part. It was released simultaneously as Always Will Be, another EP by J-Live, which is made up of eight new tracks.
The tracks "Braggin Writes" and "Schools In" were rerecorded for The Best Part, but here they appear in their original form. The tracks "Longevity", "Can I Get It", and "Hush the Crowd" had not been released on either of J-Live's previous albums.
