Short Dog's in the House is the sixth studio album by American rapper Too Short. The album was released on September 11, 1990 via Jive Records. The CD contains a number of both socially conscious songs, as well as dirty rap and sexually-explicit songs that have made Too Short famous. The album's production samples a number of classic P-funk records, as well as the heavy use of the Roland TR-808 for instrumentation. The laid-back beats (which Shaw himself dubbed "dope fiend beats") would be a major influence in hip hop years later (and would help cement Too Short's legacy as a pioneer of West coast hip hop), and the album was key in the development of West Coast born G-funk that dominated the charts for the next few years. In fact, the album's cover (as well as Short's drawl-heavy delivery) was an influence for the cover art for Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle. Upon release, the album received a number of positive reviews, making it one of Too Short's more well known albums.
The album featured a guest appearance by Ice Cube, and was the first time 2 major rap artists from Northern and Southern California collaborated on a song. The production of the album was handled mostly by a number of local Oakland-based producers (including Al Eaton, who was also known for his later work with Queen Latifah), but received production from two of Ice Cube's producers, Sir Jinx and DJ Pooh. The edited removes two songs and adds the song "What Rap?" On the edited version, "Ain't Nothin' but a Word to Me" was censored with bleep sound effects. Swearing is removed from others as well.
