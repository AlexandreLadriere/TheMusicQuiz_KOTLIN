Hell on Earth is the third studio album by East Coast hip hop duo Mobb Deep, which was first released on November 19, 1996, on Loud/RCA/BMG. The album is largely a continuation of Mobb Deep's previous album, the critically acclaimed The Infamous. The album is produced by Mobb Deep and also features guest appearances by emcees Nas, Raekwon, Method Man, and frequent collaborator Big Noyd. The album stands out for its acclaimed singles "G.O.D. Pt. III" and "Hell on Earth (Front Lines)," as well as "Drop a Gem on 'Em," a response to 2Pac's diss track "Hit 'Em Up." A promotional single, "Still Shinin'", was released earlier that year and later added to the album. The album, one of the earliest enhanced CDs, also contains an additional track ("In the Long Run") that at the time, had to be unlocked with the use of a computer.
