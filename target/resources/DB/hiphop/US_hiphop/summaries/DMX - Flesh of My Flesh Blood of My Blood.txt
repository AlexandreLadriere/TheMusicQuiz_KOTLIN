Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood is the second studio album by American rapper DMX. The album was released on December 22, 1998, a little more than seven months after his debut album It's Dark and Hell Is Hot. It entered the charts at #1 (and stayed there for 3 consecutive weeks) with over 670,000 units shipped in the first week. The album eventually went 3x Platinum in the US. He is the second rapper to have two albums released in the same calendar year debut at number one on Billboard's Top 200, the first being 2Pac with All Eyez on Me (February 1996) and The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory (November 1996), although the latter album was released posthumously under the alias Makaveli making DMX the first to release two number one albums alive by the same name in under a year.
