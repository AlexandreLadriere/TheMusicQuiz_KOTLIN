Me Against the World is the third studio album by American rapper 2Pac, released on March 14, 1995 by Out Da Gutta/Interscope Records. Drawing lyrical inspiration from his impending prison sentence, troubles with the police, and poverty, the album is described as being 2Pac's most introspective album. Steve Huey of AllMusic noted that, with Me Against the World, the rapper became markedly more "confessional," "reflective," and "soul-baring."Released while Shakur was imprisoned, the album made an immediate impact on the charts, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200. The album served as one of Shakur's most positively reviewed albums, with many calling it the magnum opus of his career; the work is considered one of the greatest and most influential hip hop albums of all time. Me Against the World won best rap album at the 1996 Soul Train Music Awards.
