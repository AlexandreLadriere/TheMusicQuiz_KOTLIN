Yo! Bum Rush the Show is the debut album by American hip hop group Public Enemy. It was recorded at Spectrum City Studios in Hempstead, New York, and released on February 10, 1987, by Def Jam Recordings and Columbia Records.
The album became one of the fastest-selling hip hop records, but was controversial among radio stations and critics, in part because of lead rapper Chuck D's black nationalist politics. It has since been regarded as one of the genre's best and most influential albums.
