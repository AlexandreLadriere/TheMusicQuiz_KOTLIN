Power of the Dollar is the unreleased debut studio album by American hip hop recording artist 50 Cent. The album was originally set to be released as his major-label debut in 2000 by Columbia Records. However, the album's release was cancelled after Columbia discovered that 50 Cent was struck by nine bullets in a shooting that took place two months before the album was set to release. Because of this, 50 Cent was later dropped from the label.  Subsequently, the album was heavily bootlegged.. There are currently no plans to release the album on compact disc.
The album features guest appearances from Destiny's Child, Noreaga, Dave Hollister, Bun B and The Madd Rapper. The album's production was handled by Trackmasters, Red Spyda, Sha Self, DJ Scratch and Erick Sermon, among other producers.
