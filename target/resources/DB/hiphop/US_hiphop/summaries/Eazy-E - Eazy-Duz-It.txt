Eazy-Duz-It  is the debut studio album by American hip hop artist Eazy-E, released on September 13, 1988, by Ruthless Records and Priority Records.
The album charted on two different charts and went Double Platinum in the United States despite very little promotion by radio and television. Three singles were released from the album, each charting in the US. The remastered version contains the 1992 EP 5150: Home 4 tha Sick. The 25th anniversary (2013) contains 2 bonus tracks, a 12" remix of "We Want Eazy" and a 12" remix of "Still Talkin'".
Eazy-Duz-It is the only full-length solo album Eazy-E released in his lifetime; for the remaining seven years of his life, he would continue recording with N.W.A until their break up in 1991, release 2 solo EPs and continue running his label Ruthless. His second and last solo album, Str8 off tha Streetz of Muthaphukkin Compton (1996), was not released until roughly a year after his death.
