Move Somethin' is the second studio album by Miami-based hip hop group 2 Live Crew. It was released on August 17, 1988 via Luke Records and was produced by Luke Skyywalker and Mr. Mixx. It was certified Gold by Recording Industry Association of America and featured the singles "Move Somethin'" and "Do Wah Diddy Diddy". The album improved on the charts from the previous album, making in to number 68 on the Billboard 200 and number 20 on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. Musically, the album incorporates samples from such diverse sources as James Brown ("With Your Badself"), Manfred Mann ("Do Wah Diddy Diddy"), The Kinks ("One and One"), Yellow Magic Orchestra ("Mega-Mixx II"), Kraftwerk ("Drop the Bomb"), and Quadrant Six (the title track). On the song "Word II", 2 Live Crew's DJ Mr. Mixx scratches up Brian May's guitar solo (as well as the chorus) on "We Will Rock You" over the crowd stomp-and-clap beat, which was sampled from the same song. Its wide musical range is nonetheless all encompassed by the Miami bass sound, in its heavy Roland TR-808 kicks and fast percussion, and as usual stamped with lyrics reflecting the group's sexually explicit humor.
