It Takes a Thief is the debut studio album by American rapper Coolio. It was released on July 19, 1994 on Warner Bros. Records. The album received praise for bringing a humorous and lighthearted perspective to often violent and profane themes of typical Gangsta rap.
"Fantastic Voyage", a hit from the early 1980s, returned to the charts after Coolio released a song of the same name from this album. The song received regular airplay on MTV and became his breakout hit, peaking at #3 in the US. Songs "Smokin Stix", "Can-o-Corn" and "Sticky Fingers" first appeared in the film Poetic Justice.
