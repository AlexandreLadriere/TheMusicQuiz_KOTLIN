Tha Doggfather is the second studio album by American rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg. It was released on November 12, 1996, by Death Row Records and Interscope Records. After the success of his debut album Doggystyle (1993), Snoop was charged with murder and in 1995, spent time preparing for the case that went to trial. In February 1996, he was cleared of all charges and began working on his second album without Dr. Dre providing work as a record producer. This was Snoop's final album on Death Row Records under his name of Snoop Doggy Dogg. Recording sessions took place from February 1996 to October 1996, with Suge Knight filling in as the executive producer on the album, alongside the additional production from several record producers such as DJ Pooh, Daz Dillinger, Soopafly and L.T. Hutton; as well as guest appearances from Charlie Wilson, Kurupt tha Kingpin, Tray Dee and Warren G, among others.
The album debuted at number one during the week of November 12, 1996, selling over 420,000 copies, but it failed to match the commercial success of Doggystyle. Dr. Dre had left Death Row to his partner Suge Knight, who was indicted for racketeering by the end of 1996. Tha Doggfather was also released only one week after another Death Row release, the first posthumous album by 2Pac, The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, which debuted at number one. Consequently, Snoop's second album stalled at sales of two million copies.
