Death Certificate is the second studio album by American rapper Ice Cube, released on October 29, 1991 by Priority Records and EMI. The album was re-released for the 25th anniversary edition on June 9, 2017 by Interscope Records after Cube announced signing to the label in late May 2017. It was highly anticipated with over one million advanced orders. The album was certified platinum in sales on December 20, 1991.Due to some of its racially and politically charged content, and Ice Cube's acerbic statements on drug dealing, racial profiling, and the right to keep and bear arms, Death Certificate was the source of both critical acclaim and much controversy upon its release. 
In 2003, Priority Records re-released Death Certificate with the bonus track "How to Survive in South Central", which originally appeared on the Boyz n the Hood soundtrack. Death Certificate included the diss track "No Vaseline" which is a response to his former hip hop group N.W.A, and their album Niggaz4Life which included direct and indirect diss tracks and verses to Ice Cube. "No Vaseline" is considered to be one of the greatest diss tracks of all time due to its explicit and direct subject matter towards the members of the group.
