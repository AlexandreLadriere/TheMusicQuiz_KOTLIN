Black Mafia Life is the second studio album by American hip hop group Above the Law. This album is what would be considered the blueprint sound similar to Dr Dre's The Chronic. The album was recorded in 1991 into 1992 but was held back due to legal issues with Epic And Dr. Dre's Departure from Ruthless Records. It was released on February 2, 1993 via Ruthless Records. The album peaked at number 6 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and number 37 on the US Billboard 200. Rolling Stone gave the album 4.5 stars of 5.
As on the group's previous works, Livin' Like Hustlers and Vocally Pimpin', this album's audio production was mostly handled by A.T.L. themselves, but this one excluded any contributions from Lay Law. It featured guest appearances from Kokane, Eazy-E, 2Pac, MC Ren, and Digital Underground. Its lead single "V.S.O.P." peaked at number 9 on the Hot Rap Singles and number 97 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks.
Above the Law member Go Mack left the group after release of this album.
