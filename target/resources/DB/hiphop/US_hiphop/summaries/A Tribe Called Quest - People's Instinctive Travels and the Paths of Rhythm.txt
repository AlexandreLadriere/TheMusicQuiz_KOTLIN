People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm is the debut album by American hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest, released on April 10, 1990 on Jive Records. After forming the Native Tongues collective and collaborating on several projects, A Tribe Called Quest began recording sessions for People's Instinctive Travels in late 1989 at Calliope Studios with completion reached in early 1990. The album's laid back production encompassed a diverse range of samples which functioned as a template for the group's unorthodox lyrics. 
People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm was met with acclaim from professional music critics and the hip-hop community on release, and was eventually certified gold in the United States. Its recognition has extended over the years as it is widely regarded as a central album in alternative hip-hop with its unconventional production and lyricism. It is also credited for influencing many artists in both hip-hop and R&B. In a commemorative article for XXL, Michael Blair wrote that "Peopleâ€™s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm was immensely groundbreaking, and will eternally maintain its relevance within the culture and construction of hip-hop".
