Yeeeah Baby is the second studio album by rapper Big Pun and the first album to be released posthumously in the wake of Big Pun's death in February 2000. It was released in April of the same year as planned, peaking at number 3 on the Billboard 200, and selling 179,000 units during the week it was released. It was subsequently certified Gold in July three months later and would go on to be certified Platinum on October 31, 2017 and has sold over 1,100,000 copies in the United States. Fat Joe, Pun's close friend and mentor, is the executive producer of the album.
Struggling with morbid obesity, Pun experienced breathing problems throughout the album’s recording process, slowing down his signature flow. He died at 28 years of age, just two months before the album’s release.
