AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted is the debut studio album by American rapper Ice Cube. It was released on May 16, 1990, by Priority Records. It serves as his first solo album, after his acrimonious split from his former group N.W.A. The album was primarily produced by Public Enemy's production team The Bomb Squad, and the album was an unexpectedly large critical and commercial success, and remains one of the defining hip hop albums of the 1990s.
