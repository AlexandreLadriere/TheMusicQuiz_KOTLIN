Business Never Personal is the fourth studio album by hip hop duo EPMD, released July 28, 1992 on Def Jam Records. Following mixed criticism of their previous studio effort, 1990's Business As Usual, the duo was able to return to their past acclaim on Business Never Personal. The album is considered the duo's third classic by fans and critics. The record was originally given a rating of 4.5 mics out of 5 in The Source in 1992. The lead single, "Crossover", became its biggest success, nearly reaching the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was about keeping it real and not crossing over to the mainstream, but became EPMD's biggest mainstream success. The duo cut "Head Banger" with Redman and K-Solo was also a hit in 1992. The album was later certified Gold in sales by the RIAA on October 13, 1992. The single "Crossover" was certified Gold on November 16, 1992. While it has yet to feature a U.S. reissue, Business Never Personal has been re-released in 2005 on vinyl in Europe.Members Erick Sermon and Parrish Smith began having money troubles during recording, which led to a 1992 robbery of Smithâ€™s home. The perpetrators claimed that Erick Sermon paid them to do the deed, causing the group to break up soon after this release. They each released two solo albums between 1993 and 1996, then reunited as a duo in 1997.
