Let the Rhythm Hit ’Em is the third studio album by rap duo Eric B. & Rakim, released on June 19, 1990. The group's sound develops further, with Rakim adopting a deeper, more aggressive tone of voice, and more mature and serious subject matter. Musically, the production ranges from smoother soulful tracks such as "In the Ghetto" to the hard-edged assault of the title track "Let the Rhythm Hit ’Em."
Despite the fact that it didn't produce any hit singles as popular as the duo's previous albums, it is considered by many to be their most coherent album, and is one of only a few rap albums that have received a 5-mic rating when it was reviewed in The Source Magazine.
In 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums.
The back cover features a dedication to the memories of Rakim's father William and producer Paul C.[2], who had worked on many of the album's tracks before his murder in July 1989. Paul's protégé Large Professor completed his work. Neither receive credit in the album's notes.
