No Limit Top Dogg is the fourth studio album and second on No Limit Records by American rapper Snoop Dogg. It was released May 11, 1999, by No Limit Records and Priority Records. Following the mixed reception of his previous two albums, Snoop began to work again with Dr. Dre and returned to the west coast sound of his earlier career while on Death Row Records. The album was generally met with positive reception with many critics citing it as a return to form and his best album since Doggystyle (1993). Many praised the production work for the album with the tracks made by Dr. Dre being highlighted as well as Snoop's delivery while criticism was mainly aimed at the length of the album, the No Limit features, and the lack of new lyrical content. The Source would later put the album on their list of the Top 10 Best Albums of the Year for 1999.No Limit Top Dogg debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, selling 187,000 copies in its first week alone in the United States, second only to Ricky Martin's self-titled album. This would be Snoop Dogg's first album to not debut at number-one and would ultimately end up being his lowest selling album of the 1990s. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As of March 2008, the album has sold 1,518,000 copies in the United States and 2 million worldwide as of 2016.
