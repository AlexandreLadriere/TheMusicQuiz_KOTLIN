Run–D.M.C. is the debut studio album of American hip hop group Run–D.M.C., released on March 27, 1984 by Profile Records. The album was produced by Russell Simmons and Larry Smith. 
It was considered groundbreaking for its time, presenting a harder, more aggressive form of hip hop. The album's sparse beats and aggressive rhymes were in sharp contrast with the light, funky sound that was popular in hip hop at the time. With the album, the group has been regarded by music writers as pioneering the movement of new school hip hop of the mid-1980s.Run-D.M.C. peaked at number 53 on the US Billboard 200, and number 14 on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. The album became the first rap album, which was certified as Gold by the RIAA (December 17, 1984).The album features five the Billboard singles: "It's Like That", "Hard Times", "Rock Box", "30 Days" and "Hollis Crew". The first single from this album, "It's Like That", released on March 12, 1983, opened a new page in the history of hip-hop with a tone of social protest (unemployment, inflation). "It's Like That" is judged by many to be the first hardcore rap song, and the first new school hip-hop recording. "Sucker M.C.'s" is one of the first diss tracks, and "Rock Box" is the first song in the rap rock genre.The album was reissued by Arista Records in 1999 and 2003. An expanded and remastered edition was released in 2005 and contained 4 previously unreleased songs.
