This article presents a list of the top selling musical albums in the world. It includes all types of albums (studio and live albums, compilations and film soundtracks) whose sales have been estimated at least 20 million copies. These albums are ranked according to their estimated sales, with top-selling albums at the top of the list. The albums for which the estimated sales are the same are sorted according to their artist, in alphabetical order.
The exact sales figures of the albums are very difficult to estimate and the sources often contradict each other about them. Record companies also tend to exaggerate sales figures, usually for commercial purposes. Those mentioned in the list below are accompanied by one or more sources, specialized or not in the musical field. However, these figures can not be considered "official" and should be taken with hindsight.
