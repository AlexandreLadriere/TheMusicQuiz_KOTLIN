Mafia K'1 Fry (pronounced Mafia Cainfri, African verlan (e)) is a French hip-hop collective from Val-de-Marne. It was founded in 1995 with mainly the most notable rappers of contemporary French rap including Rohff and members of 113. Two albums of the collective are ranked in the top 10 sales in France (Until death (7th) and The Cherry on the ghetto (8th)), as well as the DVD If you ride with the Mafia k'1 Fry is ranked 31st.
The collective is especially known for its authenticity and the deaths that affect the group Intouchable (Mamad, Las Montana and Kimbak Val-de-Marne) and the many rappers who stopped the rap to return to other occupations, but this authenticity feels even more through the sounds.
Many people do not know that this collective was very hip-hop. Many breakers make up this clan (Mokobé, Selim of 9.4, Teddy Corona), graffiti artists (AP, Duma), backers on stage (Las Montana, Mamad, Rocco, OGB), beatboxers (Mista Flo) and DJ (DJ Mehdi, DJ Mosko). Originally a breaker, Teddy Corona is a former member of Ideal J, a rap group created in the early 1990s with his friend Kery James, Rocco, and DJ Mehdi; he produced Original MC's in 1996, and Le Combat Continue in 1998. He is the initiator of the Street Heavy project Hall Stars (Small Records), a rap compilation released in November 2004, with DJ Mosko, Mista Flo, and Rocco, whose volume II was released on July 19, 2010.
The collective is also linked to a clothing brand called Mafia K'1 Fry Clothing.
