BÃ¢tards sensibles is the second album of the French rap group TTC, released October 25, 2004 at Big Dada, on which we find the three MCs of the group, Teki Latex, Tido Berman and Cuizinier.
The productions are the work of Tacteel, Tido Berman and Para One, and the scratches signed by DJ Orgasmic.
This album which combines electronic music and rap, is sold in double CD, the second CD containing the instrumental versions.
The lyrics explore themes such as menstruation, manga culture or headaches. Some [Who?] Call certain texts misogynistic, macho and indecent ("Blood on the dancefloor", "Girlfriend"), contrasting with more spoken words ("sensitive Bastard").
He was named at the twentieth edition of the Victoires de la musique in the category "best rap / hip-hop album of the year".
Sensitive Bastards also came out a year later in a Screwed & Chopped version by DJ Raze.
The four faces on the cover are the faces of the three MCs, as well as that of Orgasmic.
