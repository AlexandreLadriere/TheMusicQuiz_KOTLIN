Passi, whose real name is Passi Balende, born December 21, 1972 in Brazzaville, is a Franco-Congolese rapper, singer and composer. He is considered by the specialized press as one of the founding fathers of French rap, like NTM, IAM or MC Solaar.
He started raping in the early 1990s as a founding member of Ministry A.M.E.R. alongside Stomy Bugsy, with whom he collaborated between 1989 and 1994. Passi then decided to embark on a solo career: he signed to the V2 label and published his first album, Les Tentations, in 1997. A second album entitled Genesis will be published in 2000.
