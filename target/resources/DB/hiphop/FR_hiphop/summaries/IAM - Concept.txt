IAM Concept is the IAM demo released in cassette format in January 1990 with 300 copies, produced under the independent label Roker Promocion of the Massilia Sound System.
This cassette, birth certificate of French rap, announces the color of their first album, ... From the planet Mars, that IAM will record a year later.
Concept is also the subject of a discord between IAM and Supreme NTM, indeed two years after the release of Concept, the NTM takes again the same sample as that used on the piece The Real B-side (Marvin Gaye: T Stands for Trouble ).
This tape is now out of print and not reissued but is still available for unofficial download on the internet. The album was recorded in a week, as Akhenaten recounts in his autobiography The B side, in the water heater room of his apartment. The cover, in collages and coloring, was made by members of the group.
