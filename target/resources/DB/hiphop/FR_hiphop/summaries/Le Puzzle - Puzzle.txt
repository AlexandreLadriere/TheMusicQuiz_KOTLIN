A puzzle (pronounced in European French: /poe.zœl/ or / pözl /), also known as a puzzle in French-speaking Canada, is a game of patience which consists of reconstituting a two or three dimensional object using pieces that fit into each other. Two-dimensional puzzles are reproductions of paintings, photos or drawings. Puzzles are part of the puzzle games category. Some puzzles in three dimensions can represent for example known monuments.
The puzzle can be practiced alone or with others and in some countries is played with family during the holidays.
