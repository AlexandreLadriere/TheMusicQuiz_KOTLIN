The Ministry of Popular Affairs is a French hip-hop group from the Lille metropolis. It consists of a DJ (Stanko Fat), two rappers (Dias, HK), a violinist (Monsieur Hacène) and an accordionist (Jeoffrey Arnone).
The group professes an eclectic rap, a true reflection of the music of the North (accordion, rap worker, influence of rai, use of ch'ti). The band, which publishes the album Debout là d'in in 2006, wants to be representative of a rap-musette. By thus combining rap and accordion, MAP is sometimes compared to Java, a comparison that has been increased as a result of their joint concerts as well as the Zebda group.
