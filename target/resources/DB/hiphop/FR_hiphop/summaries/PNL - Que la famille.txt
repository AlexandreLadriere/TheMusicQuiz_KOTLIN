PNL (Peace N 'Lovés) is an independent French rap band, made up of two brothers, Ademo and N.O.S (from their real names Tarik and Nabil Andrieu,), from Tarterêts in Corbeil-Essonnes. The group is characterized by a total absence of interviews in the press, as well as by innovative cinematographic clips in France, shot around the world (Japan, United States, Italy, Iceland, South Africa, Namibia ...) as soon as its debut in 2015. The international success of their albums and their clips pushed the media to consider them as The Kings of French rap. In 2019, their last album was number one sales in France with more than 100,000 sales in a week, unpublished figure for French rap. Their clip Au DD is the most watched French music video in its first week of release, with more than 25 million views.
