Osama bin Laden (in Arabic: أسامة بن محمد بن عوض بن لادن (Usama bin Mu'ammad bin'Awaḍ bin Lādin)), born March 10, 1957 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and died on May 2, 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, killed by the US special forces, is a Saudi jihadist then stateless. A member of a family of Yemeni origin close to the Saudi royal family, having started out against the USSR during the Afghanistan war (1979-1989), he is the leader of the al-Qaida terrorist network. He claimed responsibility for the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.
The FBI, which placed him in June 1999 on his list of the ten most wanted criminals following the attacks of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, offered 25 million US dollars for any information allowing his capture, sum raised by the US Senate to 50 million in 2007 ,. The UN has prepared a list, released by Interpol in 2006, listing organizations and people close to al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. After a decade of stalking, he is located by the CIA in a fortified complex in Abbottabad, and a US Special Forces commando storms and kills him.
If he was considered a hero by some Muslims, others rejected him and condemned him. Al-Qaeda itself provokes various reactions among Islamist movements, whether militarized or not.
