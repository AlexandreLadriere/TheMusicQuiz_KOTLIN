5 major is a rap group with Fixpen Sill (Vidji and Keroué), Hors II (Hunam and Heskis) and Nekfeu (Entourage rapper, S-Crew, 1995).
The first link is between Kéroué and Heskis during the Transmusicales. The first real connection is the day Fixpen Sill, in the first part of The Rumor, invites Heskis and Nekfeu to go on stage. A little later, the 5 artists meet to realize a common project. After 3 days of intensive work, the first major project was born.

They are back on May 27, 2013 with the album Variations, 13 titles, which contains tracks like Dérapage Contrôlée, Manage your business or even The dice are thrown.
