Celtic Panic is Manau's first album released in September 1998.
Worn by the flagship song Dana Tribe which has been a national success (2 million sold singles), Celtic Panic is a great success both vis-Ã -vis the public with 1 million album sold (diamond disc ,) that of criticism by winning a Victoire de la musique in 1999 in the category "Album Rap or Groove of the Year".
The originality of Manau's sound lies in a mix between rap and Celtic music. The covers of famous Breton songs seduce the French-speaking public. One can note among them The Dana Tribe (taken from the traditional Tri Martolod, previously made famous by Alan Stivell), But who is the weasel? (Reproduction of La Mare de Michao, made famous by Tri Yann). They are both released in single and have reached the top of the Top 50. The album also has a committed song, L'Avenir is a Long Past evoking the two world wars and the rise of the National Front. The actors Vincent Desagnat and Omar Sy appear in the clip as soldiers.
A suite of 11 titles entitled Celtic Panic II, the village was released in December 2011. It contains the Celtic rap and melodies that made the success of the first record.
