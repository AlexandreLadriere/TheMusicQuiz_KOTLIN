Letter VII is a literary work in ancient Greek, dated towards the middle of the fourth century BC. J. - C., and which indicates like author the philosopher Platon, but of which it is possible that it is not his work. According to the text, this writing is addressed to a group of the Greater Sicilian Greece, to which the author addresses a political advice, but it can not be excluded that it is a literary fiction. The letter explains in detail and justifies the disputed activities of Plato at Syracuse, which tended to reform the city-state of Syracuse ruled by a tyrant to bring him to philosophical principles. The author describes the catastrophic failure of this project and tries to explain the reasons. In addition, it deals with the question of how to acquire and transmit philosophical knowledge. These developments are apparently intended for a wider audience of readers.
The work is the seventh in a collection of thirteen letters, all united under the name of Plato, but for the most part certainly or probably not composed by him. The authenticity is doubtful for some, but is not safe for any. Letter VII is by far the longest and most important of the collection and the one that has gathered the greatest number of supporters of its authenticity. If it is not authentic, it comes from a philosopher knowledgeable about Plato's entourage. That is why it is precious as a source of information on the life and political efforts of the philosopher and for the history of Sicily. From the point of view of the history of political ideas, its developments are significant for Plato's theory of knowledge, and the inadequacy of philosophical discourse. In so far as Plato is really the author, it is the oldest autobiographical text in European literary history.
The authenticity of the letter VII was hardly questioned during antiquity, but has been challenged since the late eighteenth century by a series of specialists of antiquity. After a long and intense discussion, the voices that plead for authenticity dominate within the research. Nevertheless, a large minority continue to reject or question Plato's fatherhood.
