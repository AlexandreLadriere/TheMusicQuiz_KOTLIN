Why so much hate is the first album of the department A.M.E.R., released in 1992.
This album is particularly known for its very virulent song towards the police and the state, Brigitte wife of cop. Although the album has been highly regarded because of the legal wrangling that has been caused by certain titles, the band gained notoriety and recognition with this album, allowing them to install and make their political messages heard.
