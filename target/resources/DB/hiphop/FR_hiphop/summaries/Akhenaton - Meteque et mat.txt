Métèque et mat is the first solo album of Akhenaton, from the band IAM, released in 1995. It is a very personal album, "conceived as an authentic rapped biography". He reveals a lot about his youth and his life in Marseille. He is particularly ironic about his past fascination with America in L'Américano, inspired by Tu vuo 'fa', the americano by Renato Carosone. The Mediterranean is a theme that is repeated in several songs of the album. This album is the first solo of an IAM member and is considered a classic of French rap.
