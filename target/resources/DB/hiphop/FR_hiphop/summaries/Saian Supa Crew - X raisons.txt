Saïan Supa Crew is a French hip-hop collective from the Paris suburbs. Composed of several groups - Explicit Samurai, OFX and Simple Spirit - he is one of the first groups in the history of French rap to produce songs touching musical universes as varied as bossa nova, reggae or zouk of which they are impressed, and to know a career so lightning on the European and international scene (in featuring with Daddy Mory, Busta Rhymes, RZA, Ky-Mani Marley, Ayọ ...). They stand out from the rest of the hip-hop scene thanks to their originality and their stylistic richness. The band is also popularizing beatboxing with the general public thanks to Sly the Mic Buddah and Leeroy.
