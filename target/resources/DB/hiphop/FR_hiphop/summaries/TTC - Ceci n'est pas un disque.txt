This is not a record is the first album of hip-hop TTC group, released April 22, 2002 on the label Big Dada.
The name of the album refers to the phrase "This is not a pipe" on the painting The Betrayal of Ren√© Magritte's pictures. Just as the painting of Magritte represents a pipe, the cover of the album, designed by Kid Acne, represents a vinyl record on a turntable.
Many artists such as DJ Vadim and Yarah Bravo, the duo La Caution, James Delleck and Doseone from the label anticon have participated in the production of this album.
