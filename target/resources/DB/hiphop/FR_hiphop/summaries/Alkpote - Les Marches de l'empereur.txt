Atef Kahlaoui, known as Alkpote (first under the graphic Al K-Pote), is a French rapper, born on February 3, 1981 in Paris 10th.
He found his stage name (a pun in the form of a portmanteau mixing the name of Al Capone and the word hood) at the age of 15, and joined the Unit 2 Fire Group in 1998, with which he published a first album entitled Hate, Misery and Crime. He gradually breaks away from his band to pursue a solo career. In November 2007, Alkpote released the album Suck Me Before The Album.
During his career, Alkpote is often criticized for his numerous references to pornography in his lyrics. He explains it as follows: "I am often told that I am a pornocrat, it is true. But I do not feel more pornographic than Doc Gynéco, Alizée or Mylène Farmer. We are artists first and foremost. What feeds me is my passion for rhyme, not porn. All the hard words that I use in my texts, it's just part of my character.
