Nero Nemesis is the eighth studio album of French rapper Booba released on December 4, 2015 on the Tallac Records label, and distributed by Universal. This album was released the same day as several other French rap projects, including that of his longtime rival, Rohff.
Considered to be one of the best or even the best French rap project of the year 2015, this album receives a very good critical reception, approaching a style more rap than the previous projects of the rapper. Most of the titles on the project, made under dark productions, are unanimous both on the side of the public and on the side of the media, including 92i Veyron, Like the others, 4G or even Valid√©e, which is a huge success despite a style different from other pieces, and more generally different to what Booba usually does. The album will be certified gold less than a month after its release, then double platinum a year later.
