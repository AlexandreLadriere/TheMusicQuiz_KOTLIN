The Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq was the government of Iraq until 1958, the country with a dynasty of Hashemite rulers. The kingdom is first proclaimed August 23, 1921, during the period of the British Mandate of Mesopotamia. The Mandate of the League of Nations exercised by the United Kingdom was legally annulled in 1922, but the British tutelage remained partially in place in fact until 1932, when Iraq saw its full independence recognized by law by its membership of the League of Nations (SDN). Again under British tutelage during the Second World War, the kingdom then regains its sovereignty until the 1958 coup that establishes the Republic of Iraq.
Unpopular in Iraq, the monarchs were perceived as "governors of a British colony" and, for many Iraqis, acquired the Pan-Arab ideas and influenced by the ideas of the Egyptian Nasser, the independence of the country did not go back in 1921 or 1932, but in 1958, with the coup d'etat which helped to abolish the monarchy in Iraq and place Iraqis in power.
