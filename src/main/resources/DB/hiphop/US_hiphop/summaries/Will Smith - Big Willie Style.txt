Big Willie Style is the debut solo album by American hip hop recording artist Will Smith. Recorded between 1996 and 1997 at studios in New York City, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, it was released on November 25, 1997 by Columbia Records. The album was primarily produced by Poke & Tone, with other contributors including L.E.S. and Smith's former collaborator DJ Jazzy Jeff. The album was the first to be released by Smith since 1993's Code Red, the last by the duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. Five singles were released from Big Willie Style, including Smith's first US Billboard Hot 100 number one, "Gettin' Jiggy wit It".
After releasing five albums with DJ Jazzy Jeff, Smith turned his focus to acting and appeared in such films as Bad Boys and Independence Day before returning to the studio in 1996. The following year he starred in Men in Black, for which he recorded the song of the same name and topped the singles charts in several countries. Big Willie Style was released later in the year, reaching the top ten of the US Billboard 200, the UK Albums Chart and several other international charts.
