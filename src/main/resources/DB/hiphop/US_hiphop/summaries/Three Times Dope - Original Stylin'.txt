Three Times Dope was a hip hop/rap group from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania consisting of EST (Robert Waller), Chuck Nice (Walter Griggs) and Woody Wood (Duerwood Beale). 3xD, as they were called for short, were a part of the Hilltop Hustlers Crew (which also included Steady B, Cool C, Da Youngsta's, Mentally Gifted, and others). At first, they recorded under the name 3-D.
Their debut LP, Original Stylin' was well-received, peaking at #122 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart and the group became well known for the terminology they created, such as “Acknickulous” and “The Giddy Up”.
3xD's follow-up album Live from Acknickulous Land was an attempt at a more serious work. Despite spawning two minor hits, it failed to chart on the Billboard 200. It did, however, peak at #30 on Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Album chart.3xD later became closely associated with rapper/producer Kwamé. Their third album, Da Sequel, was not released until 1998.
EST would eventually go on to become an award-winning songwriter for top-tier acts, most notably a Grammy nomination in 2005 for Destiny's Child's "Cater 2 U".
