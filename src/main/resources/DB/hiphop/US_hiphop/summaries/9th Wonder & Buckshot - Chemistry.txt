Chemistry is a 2005 collaboration album by Buckshot of the Boot Camp Clik and 9th Wonder of Little Brother. 9th provides all the production on the release, and handled all recording and mixing except for the song "No Comparison" which was recorded by Khrysis, while leaving the rapping to Buckshot, with guest appearances from members of the Boot Camp Clik and the Justus League. This album is paralleled by the Black Moon album "Alter the Chemistry", which was basically a remix album produced by Da Beatminerz.
