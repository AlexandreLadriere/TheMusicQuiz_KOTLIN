Paul's Boutique is the second studio album by the American hip hop group Beastie Boys. Released on July 25, 1989, on Capitol Records, it was produced by the Dust Brothers. Apart from the vocals, is was almost entirely composed from samples. Recorded in Matt Dike's apartment and the Record Plant in Los Angeles from 1988 to 1989, and mixed at the Record Plant, Paul's Boutique did not match the sales of the Beastie Boys' debut album Licensed to Ill, and Capitol made little effort to promote it. As its popularity grew in the years following, it became recognized as breakthrough achievement and a classic hip-hop landmark. Its innovative lyrical and sonic style earned the Beastie Boys' a position as critical favorites within the hip-hop community. Sometimes described as the "Sgt. Pepper of hip-hop", the album's rankings near the top of many publications' "best albums" lists in disparate genres has given Paul's Boutique critical recognition as a landmark album in hip hop.
