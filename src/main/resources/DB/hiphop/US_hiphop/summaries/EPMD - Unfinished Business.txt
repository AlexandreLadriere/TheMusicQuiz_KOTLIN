The lead single, "So Wat Cha Sayin'," was the only charting single released from the album. In 1998 the album was selected as one of The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums and, in 2005, was ranked #7 on comedian Chris Rock's Top 25 Hip-Hop Albums of all-time list for Rolling Stone magazine.  It was the second album from the group to hit #1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.
The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on October 16, 1989. It was one of three albums that Priority/EMI Records acquired from Sleeping Bag Records when it ceased operations in 1991.
