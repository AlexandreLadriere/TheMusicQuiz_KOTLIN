Here to Save You All is the debut album by rapper Chino XL released on April 9, 1996. It is predominantly produced by B Wiz and only held two guest appearances from Ras Kass and Kool Keith. It was produced mostly by Chino's close associates, and the lyrical content revolved around dark, hardcore themes (mostly metaphorical braggadoccio), dismissing the commercialized hip hop that was starting to gain momentum at this time. It contains the infamous but well-known song "Riiiot!" which had a line that possibly alluded to the rumor of West Coast rapper 2Pac being raped in prison. 2Pac later called him out on "Hit Em Up," and Chino responded with a freestyle dis. Chino himself stated that the line was not meant as a dis, and he and 2Pac were on good terms at the time of his death.
