Can I Borrow a Dollar? is the debut studio album by American rapper Common Sense, released on October 6, 1992 by Relativity Records. The album was entirely produced by No I.D. (then called Immenslope) and The Twilite Tone, with additional production by The Beatnuts, and includes guest vocals from Immenslope, Miss Jones and Common's then-girlfriend Rayshel. Entertainment Weekly's Neil Drumming described it as "a clever but little-noticed first album".
