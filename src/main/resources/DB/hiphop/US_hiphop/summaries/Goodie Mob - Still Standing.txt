Still Standing is the second studio album from the Dirty South, Dungeon Family-affiliated hip hop quartet Goodie Mob. All of the original members (Big Gipp, Cee-Lo, T-Mo, and Khujo) are still together for this album. This album was released in 1998 under LaFace Records as a follow up to the southern classic Soul Food. Additional lyrical contributors include fellow Atlanta natives Big Boi and Dre of OutKast, Cool Breeze, Chiefton, Witchdoctor, and Backbone. It's an "Enhanced CD" with direct links to the Goodie Mob and LaFace websites. Executive produced by Antonio M. Reid, Kenneth B. Edmonds, and Organized Noize for Organized Noize Productions, Inc. Just About Over is a full blown rock song. The album was certified Gold in later 1998 and has become Goodie Mob's best album next to Soul Food.
