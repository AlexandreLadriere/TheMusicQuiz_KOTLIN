When Disaster Strikes... is the second studio album by American rapper Busta Rhymes, released by Elektra on September 23, 1997. The album follows the same theme as The Coming, the apocalypse. The album was a commercial success, sporting the hit singles "Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See" and "Dangerous". The album, upon its release, has received praise from most music critics, and opened at number three on the official US Billboard 200 album chart, and peaked at the top spot on the Top R&B Albums chart. 
The album generated three singles: "Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See", "Dangerous", and "Turn It Up" â€“ the latter two which found chart success on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The album's lead single, "Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See" (notable for its music video that lampooned the 1988 film Coming to America) earned a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA. Its second single, "Dangerous", earned Rhymes a third consecutive nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 41st Grammy Awards the following year.
