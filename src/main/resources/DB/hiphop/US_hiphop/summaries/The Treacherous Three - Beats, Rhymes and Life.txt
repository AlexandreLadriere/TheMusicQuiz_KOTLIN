Chopper or chopper rap is a hip hop music style that originated in the Midwestern United States and features fast-paced rhyming or rapping. Those that rap in the style are known as choppers, and rapping in the style is sometimes referred to as chopping. The style is one of the major forms of Midwest hip hop, though by the early 1990s it had spread to other parts of the United States including California and New York City, and it has spread across the world since.
Chopper style places an emphasis on speed of pronunciation, and as such is commonly attributed to some of the fastest professional rappers, such as Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Twista, Tech N9ne, Twisted Insane, Busta Rhymes, Rebel XD, Krizz Kaliko and Jaz-O. Vocalist Oli Peters of the tech-death band Archspire is also heavily influenced by this style.
