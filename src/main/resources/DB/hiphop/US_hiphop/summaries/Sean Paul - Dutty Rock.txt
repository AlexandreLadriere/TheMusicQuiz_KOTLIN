Dutty Rock (West Indian patois for "dirty rock") is the second studio album by Jamaican reggae/dancehall artist Sean Paul. It was released on 12 November 2002. It features two U.S. number-one singles, "Get Busy" and Beyoncé's "Baby Boy" (which Sean Paul features on).

The album itself reached #2 on the UK Albums Chart, and #9 on the US Billboard 200 Albums Chart. It is also his first album to have a Parental Advisory sticker. The album sold 65,000 in its first week and went on to become an international phenomenon, selling over 6 million worldwide, and in the process produced five top 15 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. His single " Top Of The Game" was featured on "NBA Live 2004"
In 2003, Sean Paul released an edited version of the album intended for international markets. The re-release took off all skits and the single "It's On", also featuring the now accessible hit single "Baby Boy". The single is a duet by Beyoncé and Sean Paul. It became one of the biggest hits in 2003 spending nine weeks at number one. The album sold over 2 million copies in the United States and helped Sean Paul become a Grammy Award-winning artist. Also, the version of "Punkie" is a remix and features Puerto Rican artist Tego Calderón singing his part in Spanish.
