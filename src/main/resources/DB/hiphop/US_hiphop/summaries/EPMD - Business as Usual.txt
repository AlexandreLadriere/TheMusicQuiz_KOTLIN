Business as Usual is the third album from Hip Hop duo EPMD, released December 15, 1990 and their first on leading rap label Def Jam as a result of being signed over (along with Nice & Smooth) from their former label, Fresh Records.  This album was also the first release by Def Jam as an imprint under its new Rush Associated Labels subsidiary, which allowed founder Russell Simmons more control and more ownership over its material, as the masters for proper Def Jam releases at that time were primarily owned by Sony Music's Columbia Records. Business as Usual was not as acclaimed as their first two albums, but was not considered to be a failure either. One notable aspect here was the debut of future Hip Hop star Redman, who appears on the tracks "Hardcore" and "Brothers on My Jock". Three singles were released from the album, "Gold Digger", "Rampage (Slow Down, Baby)" featuring LL Cool J and "Give the People". In 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums.
The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on May 7, 1991.
