Sol Invictus (Latin for "Unconquered Sun") is a solar deity that appeared in the Roman Empire in the third century. It takes again aspects of the mythology of Apollo and the worship of Mithra, knowing a great popularity in the Roman army.
The emperor Aurelian (270-275) assures him an official place in Rome proclaiming that the undefeated Sun is the main patron of the Roman Empire and making of December 25 (the winter solstice then fell on December 25, spring equinox having been fixed on March 25th before the modification of the Council of Nicaea) an official holiday called the "day of birth of the Sun" (of the Latin dies natalis solis invicti). This festival is then placed in the extension of the Saturnalia, an old and most important holiday period in Rome. A temple is dedicated to the Sun in the Field of Mars, and adorned with the booty reported from Palmyra; this temple is served by a new college of priests, the Solis pontiffs.
One of his successors, Constantine I, the first Roman emperor converted to Christianity, was at the beginning of his reign adept of the undefeated Sun, as evidenced by its monetary issues. He made Sunday (called in Rome "day of the sun") a day of rest in tribute to Sol Invictus by a law of March 7, 321. The first Christians were already celebrating Sunday as the day of the resurrection of Christ and "first day of the week", and gathered for a Eucharist on Sunday evening. However, one of the Messianic titles applied to Jesus being "sun of righteousness", a syncretism with Roman solar symbolism was carried out in a Christian context.
During the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the celebration of the birth of Jesus of Nazareth on December 25 by the Christians of Rome gradually replaced the cult of Sol Invictus ,. The Thessalonian edict of 380, decreed by Theodosius I, definitely forbids the worship of Sol Invictus, making December 25 an exclusively Christian holiday.
