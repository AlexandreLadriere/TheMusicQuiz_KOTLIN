A zeppelin is a rigid dirigible aerostat of German manufacture; in the usual language, the word "zeppelin" may refer, by extension, to any type of airship. It was the German Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin who began construction at the end of the 19th century.
The highly developed design of the Zeppelin airships makes them archetypal standards of rigid airships, so that the proper name Zeppelin becomes a common name, thus joining the list of brand names used as common names. Strictly speaking, this common name initially refers only to German rigid airships: the French rigid airship Spiess (built by Zodiac in 1912), for example, although closely resembling a zeppelin, was never named in this way. .
Rigid airships differ from flexible airships in that they use an aerodynamic outer envelope mounted on a rigid structure with several separate balloons called "cells". Each cell contains a lighter gas than air (usually hydrogen). A relatively small compartment for passengers and crew is added in the bottom of the frame. Several internal combustion engines provide propulsive energy.
In addition to the creation of the aircraft company LZ (Luftschiffbau Zeppelin), which produced a total of one hundred and nineteen aircraft until 1938, Count von Zeppelin founded the world's first commercial airline named DELAG (Deutsche Luftschiffahrts). -AG). Both companies are based in Friedrichshafen, Germany.
Having since 1913 doubts about the validity of the concept of airships, the count creates a branch, in collaboration with Bosch and Klein, the VGO (of) Versuch Gotha Ost, Staaken thereafter (which will produce aircraft bombers "giants", but of conventional design), as well as an aviation department within LZ, which will be headed by Claudius Dornier and responsible for more innovative research on metallic aircraft.
When the count died in 1917, Hugo Eckener succeeded him as head of the company. He is both a master of advertising and a very experienced aircraft captain. It is under his leadership that zeppelins reach their peak. The company is prosperous until the 1930s and carries out transport from Germany to the United States and South America. The most successful aircraft during this period is the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, which travels more than a million and a half kilometers and completes the first and only airship tour of the world.
The Great Depression and the rise of Nazism in Germany both contribute to the disappearance of aircraft carrying passengers. In particular, Eckener and the Nazis have a mutual hatred: LZ was nationalized by the German government around 1935. It closed a few years later, following the LZ 129 Hindenburg disaster, during which the flagship caught fire in Lakehurst in New Jersey.
During the twenties of Zeppelins' existence in the airline, the operation of this type of balloon is quite profitable and the voyages are carried out safely, until the fire of the Hindenburg.
