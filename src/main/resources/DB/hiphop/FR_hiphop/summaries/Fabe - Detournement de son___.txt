Fabe, born May 9, 1971 in Paris, is a French rapper. His stage name is the diminutive of Fabrice's first name. He was a member of the Scred Connexion collective.
Fabe's first album, Befa surprises his brothers, was released in 1994. The title It's part of my past has a good radio promotion and the clip turns quickly. In the run, Fabe publishes his second album The bottom and the form in 1997. This time, it is the title Letter to the president which stands out strongly. Fabe denounces the abuse of power of politicians and more specifically President Jacques Chirac, newly elected. The title Of the hard, the bosses ... Dombis is adapted in clip. In 1997, Fabe made an appearance with East (recorded after the death of the latter) on the album The School of the silver microphone of the group IAM on the piece L'Enfer.
In the early 2000s, while his album The Rage to Say has just been released, he embraces Islam and decides to withdraw from the world of music. After spending several years studying the Qur'an, he said in a statement on his blog that he would not wish for anything in the world to make a return on the scene of French rap. After 10 years of media silence, he says in a written interview - given in 2013 - to be married, a father and a student of Islamic studies.
