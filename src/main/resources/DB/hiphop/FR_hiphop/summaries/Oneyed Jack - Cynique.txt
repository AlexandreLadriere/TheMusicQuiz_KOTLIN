Oneyed Jack was a French rock band (fusion) from Paris. Founded in 1992, it was one of the pioneers of the fusion scene in France. It consisted of Ludo Wangermez (sampler, machines), Fabrice Baldet (vocals), Julien Reymond (bass guitar), MickaÃ«l Roger (guitar), Lionel Sellier (drums) and Guillaume Cavanna (DJ). The name of the band is borrowed from David Lynch's "Casino Bordel" series Twin Peaks.
