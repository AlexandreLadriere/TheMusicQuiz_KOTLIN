Revisiting A Spring is IAM's 4th studio album released on September 16, 2003.
After many years without a common project, IAM returns to complete a new album, quite different from the previous one, especially at the musical level. The tone is still engaged, while the group offers some prestigious guests like Method Man, Redman, Syleena Johnson or Beyonc√©.
We also note that Freeman intervenes on many more titles than before alongside the two emblematic leaders Akhenaton and Shurik'n.
The album is platinum disc with more than 300,000 copies sold to date.
