The castle of Chenonceau is a castle of the Loire located in Touraine, in the town of Chenonceaux, in the department of Indre-et-Loire in the Center-Val de Loire region.
Chenonceau with its famous two-storey gallery overlooking the Cher is one of the jewels of the architecture of the Loire Valley. Its borrowings from Italy and its French characteristics are clearly perceptible.
Chenonceau is built, arranged and transformed by women very different in their temperament. It was built by Katherine Bri√ßonnet in 1513, enriched by Diane de Poitiers and enlarged under Catherine de Medici. It becomes a place of recollection with the white queen Louise of Lorraine, then it is safeguarded by Louise Dupin during the French Revolution and finally, metamorphosed by Madame Pelouze.
Due to the large number of female personalities who have been in charge, it is nicknamed the Castle of the Ladies.
The private estate of Chenonceau belongs to the Menier family since 1913 and is open to visitors.
The castle is classified as historical monuments since its inscription on the list of 1840 and the park by decree dated November 7, 1962.
