The attacks of September 11, 2001 (commonly called September 11th, or 9/11 and Nine eleven in English) are four suicide bombings perpetrated the same day in the United States, in less than two hours, between 8:14 and 10:03 , by members of the al-Qaida jihadist network, targeting symbolic buildings in the north-east of the country (including the World Trade Center, already attacked in 1993) and killing 2,977 people. Operation Bojinka is considered a precursor to these attacks, committed two days after the suicide bombing that killed Commander Ahmed Chah Massoud.
On the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001, nineteen terrorists hijack four airliners. Two planes are projected on the twin towers of the World Trade Center (WTC) in Manhattan (New York) and a third on the Pentagon, headquarters of the Department of Defense in Washington, killing all the people on board and many others working in these buildings. The two towers (whose peaks rise to a little over 415 m in height) collapse less than two hours later, causing the destruction of two other buildings. The fourth plane, flying towards Washington, crashes in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after passengers and crews, who were warned by telephone about what was happening elsewhere, tried to regain control of it. .
The attacks of September 11, 2001 are the deadliest attacks ever perpetrated. 6,291 people were injured in these attacks, which killed 2,973 people in 95 countries, including 343 members of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY), 37 members of the Port Authority Police Department, and 23 members of the New York City Police Department (2,992 deaths including the nineteen hijackers), according to official figures from the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States, issued on July 22, 2004 ,,. The site of the 9/11 memorial built on the site of the World Trade Center Twin Towers finally lists 2,977 victims (including nearly 2,200 employees working in the World Trade Center).
On October 17, 2001, Mary Robinson, in charge of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, described the attacks as crimes against humanity, while they were the subject of multiple theories of conspiracy, denounced as "revisionist" or even "negationist" theories,. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States was created in 2002 to explain how these attacks have occurred and to prevent this from happening again. In its report published in late August 2004, it establishes the responsibility of the Al-Qaeda network, claiming that the nineteen terrorists of these suicide bombings were members and that the sponsor is Osama bin Laden, who claims them to several times ,. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is designated as the main organizer of these attacks and acknowledges the facts, during preliminary interrogations at his trial, considered as torture by human rights organizations ,.
The events of September 11 have been experienced almost in real time by hundreds of millions of viewers around the world and have caused a considerable psychological shock, the images of the plane hitting the second tower of the World Trade Center as well as those of the complete collapse in seconds of the two towers of the World Trade Center were broadcast live.
The US federal government and many other countries have responded by strengthening their anti-terrorism legislation. The US administration then launched a "war on terror", including in Afghanistan in October 2001, whose al-Qaeda-friendly Taliban regime was suspected of harboring bin Laden, and in Iraq in March 2003, including the Ba'athist regime. has been designated by the US administration as a supporter of international terrorism and a holder of weapons of mass destruction. Osama bin Laden is finally spotted in Pakistan, and killed by an American commando on May 2, 2011. The Pentagon is repaired in one year and six new towers, including the One World Trade Center which is the highest in the United States, a memorial installed on the site of the twin towers, a museum dedicated to the bombings and a new station are, in 2019, under construction, completion or already built and in service on the site of the World Trade Center.
