Who sows the wind harvest tempo is the first album of MC Solaar released in 1991. It is considered as a pioneer album of French rap with the song Bouge de l√† considered as the first big hit of French rap. The name of the album is based on a proverb from the book of Hosea "who sows the wind, harvests the storm".
The album is co-produced by Hubert Boom Bass, future half of the Cassius band.
The album is no longer available for sale since the early 2000s following a judgment between the artist and his former record company (Polydor). It is also unavailable on streaming and purchase platforms.
