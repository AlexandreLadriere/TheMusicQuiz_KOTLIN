The Fonky Family is a French hip-hop band, originally from Marseille, in the Bouches-du-Rhône. Formed in 1994, it consists of Rat Luciano (Christophe Carmona), Sat the Artificer (Karim Haddouche), Don Choa (François Dilhan), Menzo (Mohamed Ali), Pone (Guilhem Gallart), Fel (Karim Laoubi) and DJ Djel (Djelalli El-Ouzeri), who marked the beginnings of French rap in the 1990s and 2000s. For the first part of a Sens Unik concert, the rap group Fonky Family from Marseille was formed.
In the summer of 1997, the Fonky Family recorded its very first album, and in January 1998 released God willing ..., which quickly became a gold record, until reaching the status of gold double-disc in 1998. He is followed by the album Art de Rue, published in March 2001. The last album, Marginale Musique, is published in 2006. The band splits in 2007, each member of the group now pursuing a career in solo. The Fonky Family has, in 2006, two platinum discs, and three gold discs.
