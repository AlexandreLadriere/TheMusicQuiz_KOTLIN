Sector Ä (contraction of sect Abdulaï, which refers to a character from a movie Double Détente and the nickname of the city Valéry, a district of Sarcelles) is a French hip-hop collective created by members of the Ministry A.M.E.R. and whose leader and boss was Kenzy. Most of the artists present at the base came from Val-d'Oise (Garges-lès-Gonesse, Sarcelles or Villiers-le-Bel). The collective sold more than 6 million albums between 1996 and 2001.
From 1999 and 2000, many artists leave the collective. The publishing company Sector Ä is in a state of decay on 9 September 2005.
In 2018, the Sector Ä made its media return for an event tour that will take place throughout France bringing together the collective from start to finish: Ärsenik, Doc Gynéco, Stomy Bugsy, Passi, Neg 'Marrons, Pit Baccardi, MC Janik and Singuila , 20 years after their concert at the Olympia in 1998.
