The Kabbalah Center is a non-profit organization based in Los Angeles, California that offers classes at centers around the world and online courses on the teachings of The Zohar and Kabbalah. The presentation of Kabbalah was developed by its director, Rav Philip Berg, with his wife, Karen Berg. The Kabbalah Center has an international teaching staff that provides kabbalistic studies and advice to its global student community.
Rabbis traditionally believed that the mysteries of Kabbalah were so complex and so easily misunderstood that students (mainly men) could not be taught until the age of 40. As a result, some traditionalists had seen in the Center of Kabbalah a perversion of the ancient and secret mystical tradition of Judaism.
