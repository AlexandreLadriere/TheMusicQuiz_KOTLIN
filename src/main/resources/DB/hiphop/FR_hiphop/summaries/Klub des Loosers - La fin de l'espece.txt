Fuzati is a French rapper born in 1978. A native of Versailles, he is a member and founder of the French hip-hop group Klub des Loosers.
Discreet on his private life, Fuzati always keeps his mask during his appearances in public; it is a way for him to distinguish his daily life from the character he embodies in the world of rap.
