Oxmo Puccino, whose real name is Abdoulaye Diarra, born August 4, 1974 in Ségou, Mali, is a Franco-Malian rapper. The main singularity of Oxmo Puccino lies in his writing, based on metaphors and shock sentences. This link to the French song earned him the nickname "Black Jacques Brel". He considers himself a "singer" and a "poemian". Oxmo is the brother of Mamoutou Diarra, a French basketball international.
With the other rappers of the 19th arrondissement, Pit Baccardi and the Jedi (Kassim and Kamal Haussmann), he joined the collective Time Bomb, which allows him to collaborate with the X-Men, Lunatic (Booba and Ali) and Hifi. While the original Time Bomb collective separates, Oxmo Puccino signs a contract with the Virgin label and publishes his first studio album, Opera Puccino, in 1998, which takes eight years to earn his gold certification in 2006. His sixth album, Roi sans carrosse, is published on September 17, 2012. In November 2015, he publishes his seventh album entitled La Voix lactée. Oxmo Puccino's eighth studio album, The Night of Wake, will be released on September 6th.
After twenty years of career, Oxmo is the only MC to have collaborated with almost all the big names of French rap.
