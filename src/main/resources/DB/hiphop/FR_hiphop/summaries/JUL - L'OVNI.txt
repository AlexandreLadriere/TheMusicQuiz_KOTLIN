Jul (/ d íul /), scene name of Julien Mari, is a French singer and rapper, born on January 14, 1990 in Marseille.
He released his first single, Sort the stolen cross, in November 2013. The single is followed in February 2014 by an entire album, In my paranoia, the first in a prolific series: 2 full albums per year since the beginning of its career, all awarded at least a gold record.
In 2015, Jul leaves the Liga One Industry label as a result of financial disagreements and establishes his own independent label, D'or and platinum. The following year, he received the award for best urban music album at the 32nd Victoires de la musique for the album My World.
