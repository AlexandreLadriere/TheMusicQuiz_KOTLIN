In the eyes of his supporters, he is an advocate involved in the rights of African Americans who have indicted the US federal government for segregating the black community. On the other hand, his detractors accuse him of having fueled a form of racism, black supremacism and violence.
Born Malcolm Little, he adopts the pseudonym Malcolm X during his passage in 1952 in the movement Nation of Islam. He finally moved away from it in 1964, mainly because of disagreements over the organization's passivity in the fight against racial segregation. He then evolves, shortly before his death, towards socialist and internationalist positions. He is assassinated on February 21, 1965 by three militants of Nation of Islam but a possible implication of the FBI is evoked.
