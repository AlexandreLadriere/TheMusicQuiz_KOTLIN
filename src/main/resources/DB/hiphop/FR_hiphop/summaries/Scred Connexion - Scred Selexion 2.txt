The Scred Connexion (scred meaning "discreet" in verlan) is a French hip-hop band from Paris. Formed in the mid-1990s, the band is initially composed of Fabe, Koma, Haroun, Mokless and Morad, with the help of Butch. The concept of collective includes the fact that each MC is independent and that the members of the group get together to form the "Scred". Fabe decides to stop rap in 2000, after his last solo album.
