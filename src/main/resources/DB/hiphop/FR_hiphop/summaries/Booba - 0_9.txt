0.9 is the fourth studio album of French rapper Booba, released on November 24, 2008 on the Tallac Records label via Major Barclay and Universal.
In its first week of operation, the album has a weak start with 17,540 copies, a figure well below the expectations of the rapper's record label. The album is considered a flop in the rapper's discography due to low sales (less than 100,000).
At the same time as his album, he will release a pair of Nike Air Force 1 with flags from Senegal, the K of his brand Unkut and a drawing of a dead pirate with a laser-drawn crown by the tattoo artist Laura Santana. The pair will be released on December 6, 2008 at the Boulbi & co shop, limited to 176 copies.
