A virus is an infectious agent requiring a host, often a cell, whose metabolism and its constituents it uses to replicate. The name virus is borrowed from the Latin virus ("juice, juice, humor, venom, poison, bad smell, stench, infection"). The science of viruses is virology, and its experts are virologists or virologists.
Viruses are increasingly considered to be part of the acaryotes. Viruses change shape during their cycle, they go through two stages:

an extracellular form (independent material unit called a virion when there is a capsid or, for some forms, a viroid). In the extracellular form, viruses are particulate, infectious objects, consisting of at least one nucleic acid often encompassed in a capsid of proteins;
an intracellular form (integrated virus in dormant form or actively diverting the cellular machinery for the benefit of its replication). In the intracellular form (inside the host cell), viruses are genetic elements that can replicate by parasitizing all or part of the host cell's metabolism, whether it is integrated into a chromosome of the host genome (we are talking about then provirus) or parallel to it (for example virion factories). Contrary to popular belief, if viruses are still infectious, only a minority are pathogenic. Of the 3,600 species described, only 129 are pathogenic to humans.
The debate about the nature of viruses (alive or not) is based on complex notions, and remains open today. According to many definitions of the living (material entity performing the functions of relationship, nutrition, reproduction), viruses would not be living beings. However, by extending the definition of the living to an entity that decreases the level of entropy and reproduces itself by making mistakes, viruses could be considered as living beings.
