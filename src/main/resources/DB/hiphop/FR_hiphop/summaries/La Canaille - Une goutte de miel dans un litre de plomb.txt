A drop of honey in a liter of lead is the first album of the French rap group La Canaille, worn by Marc Nammour, released in 2009.
For the critic Benjamin Mailot of Les Inrocks, the album "is indeed a double revelation. That of a group whose instrumental bravery and critical combativity are high on the free-zone project [...] and that of a MC with a vocal presence to make Psykick Lyrikah's arm white ".
