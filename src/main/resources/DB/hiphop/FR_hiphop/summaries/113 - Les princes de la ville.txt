The Princes of the City is the first album of 113, rap group Vitry member of the Mafia K'1 Fry. It was released on October 27, 1999.
The instrumental dressing was mainly done by DJ Mehdi. With this album, the producer of Ideal J has breathed electro sounds to rap compositions, while concluding some pieces with long instrumental tracks. Pone, a member of the Fonky Family, remains in this vein with the two tracks he produces in the album.
We note the participation in the realization of Manu Key alongside the three rappers (Rim'K, AP and Mokob√©).
The success of the album has also favored the emergence on the national scene of the Mafia K'1 Fry, collective Val-de-Marne composed including Rohff, Kery James and Intouchable. The album sells over 350,000 copies.
