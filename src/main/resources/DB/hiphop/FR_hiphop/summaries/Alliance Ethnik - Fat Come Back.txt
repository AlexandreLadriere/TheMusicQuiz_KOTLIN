Alliance Ethnik is a French hip-hop band from Creil, Oise. Formed in 1990 and dissolved in 1999. It consisted of five members of various origins (Algerian, Italian, French and Congolese), hence the name Alliance Ethnik (Ethnik is a cacography of the word "ethnic"): K -Mel, MÃ©dard, Gutsy, Crazy B, and Faster Jay.
Alliance Ethnik is known for its dance-inspired singles inspired by funk, oriented West Coast rap in a French rap medium of the mid-1990s saturated by New York trends. In 1995, the band released its first album, Simple and funky, a hit in France, Belgium and Switzerland, thanks to singles like Simple and funky, Respect or Honesty and jealousy (make a choice in life). The second album, Fat comeback, published in 1999, does not meet the same success; the group separates the same year.
