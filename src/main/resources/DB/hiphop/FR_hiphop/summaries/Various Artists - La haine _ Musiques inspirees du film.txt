La Haine, musics inspired by the film is a compilation of French rap grouping songs inspired by the screenplay of the film The Hate to "transform the visual spectrum of the film and amplify the vision of The Hate". The album is not the soundtrack of the film.
The NTM band, originally planned, did not wish to participate in this album.
