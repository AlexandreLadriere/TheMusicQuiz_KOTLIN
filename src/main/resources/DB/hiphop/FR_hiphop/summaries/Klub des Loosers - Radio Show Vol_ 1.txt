Klub des Loosers is a French hip-hop band. Formed in 2000, the group initially consists of the leader and founder Fuzati, accompanied by DJ Orgasmic. From now on, Fuzati alone represents the Klub, accompanied by DJ Detect. Other members took part in the project without staying permanently like James Delleck of Gravity Zero, Teki Latex of TTC, Tacteel and Para One of FuckALoop. Fuzati puts forward in his songs a deep malaise, however shot with a lot of irony and self-mockery.
